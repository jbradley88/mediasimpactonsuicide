        Social Media Platform's Involvement
      </h1>
      <h2 class="media">
        Facebook
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
          Facebook has a close partnership with The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline that allows Facebook to be a social media platform that cares about the safety of their users. 
          Facebook closely moniters post from its users and if a post is reported to be suicidal it is looked at by a team at Facebook and action is taken on the problem. 
          Facebook will send the reported user a message saying a friend of theirs is concerned for their well being. Facebook will also send them helpful resources that can allow the user to find help from qualified people.
    </p>
      <h2 class="media">
        Twitter
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
         Twitter has protocols in place to carefully monitor tweets that are related to self harm or suicide.
        Once a tweet gets flagged for self harm or suicide a team at twitter begins the process of reaching out to the person who posted the tweet. 
        The team will reach out to the person and let them know that people are concerned about their well being and will share resources and encourage the person to seek help. 
        Twitter also motivates their users to reach out to the person and let them know that the are worried and that they should seek the necessary help.

      </p>
      <h2 class="media">
        Instagram
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Instagram has the option for users to report posts for suicidal content or content that promotes self-harm. 
        Instagram will look into the reported post and if it feels like it does promote these type of ideas, they will remove the post from the app. 
        Instagram states that for any post that is considered suicidal or puts the user at risk, they will reach out to the user and provide resources for the user to seek help.

      </p>
      <h2 class="media">
        Snapchat
      </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Snapchat does not have a designated way to report suicidal content within the app, but users have the ability to report content on Snapchatâ€™s website. 
        After the concern is deemed a suicidal threat the user is given contact information for suicidal hot lines. 
        The user is also urged to reach out to the local law enforcement incase immediate action needs to be taken. 
        If the resources given are not enough the user is able to receive more support by filling out another form that gives even more support for the user.

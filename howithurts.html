        Cyberbullying
        </h2>
      <p class="p">
        Cyberbullying is the harassment and/or bullying of another person through any online resource. Cyberbullying has grown increasingly more common among the American population, mainly teens, as the amount of the social media outlets has increased. Cyberbullying has had a direct impact on suicide rates because it remove the geographical barriers of bullying. Of a student is bullied in school, they can usually be safe within their own home. However, social media and cyberbullying has allowed predators to bully people even when they're not physically together. A study was conducted on middle school students on how social media affects their life at home. About 2000 students said they have been victims of some sort of cyberbullying and are two times more likely to attempt suicide.

      <p class="p">
        Unlike ever before, the internet gives people the ability to find information on a topic they wish to research with a simple click of a button. This is usually beneficial to the society when someone needs to find an Apple Pie recipe, but it less beneficial when someone is searching instructions on how to harm themselves. When someone is having suicidal thoughts and contemplating the idea of ending their own life, the internet can provide articles explaining various processes of how to commit suicide. In addition,  a person can easily search youtube or other video platform websites to find videos of people harming themselves. With this information readily available, a person might feel that their suicidal feelings are justified and push them over the edge.

        Isolation
        </h1>
        <p class="p">
          Nowadays, most every teenager is own a social media platform, more than likely, more than one. While these platforms provide people with the ability to communicate with others through messages and pictures, it also can magnify the isolation felt by someone who doesnâ€™t have as many followers/friends. For example, if someone sees a post on instagram with 500 likes and 200 comments and their own post only has 11 likes a 0 comments, their self esteem will decrease drastically. This person who is suffering a decrease in their self esteem can grow to envy a person who has more social media fame than them. If someone feels they can never live up to the standards set by others, they may lose hope of ever being accepted.

          When someone is feeling down about themselves and do not have options to gain support, they may reach out to online sources in an attempt to feel needed. While many online sources are aimed at helping individuals who are in need, there are also organizations who are aimed to take advantage of vulnerable individuals. When an organization is able to manipulate an individual, they may be convinced to commit actions that what not normally do.
